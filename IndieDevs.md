# Guidelines for Indie Devs

**Deadline:** The sales run from July 11-12, and in order to be sure your app is listed, PLEASE SUBMIT BEFORE NOON ON JULY 10th (Eastern Daylight Time).

Interested in joining? Create a Pull Request with your info. I'm trying to get to Pull Requests as quickly as I can, but I should be able to add you same day - if it seems slow, just ping me on Mastodon.

A few things that will help:

- Please ensure that you've configured your discounts in AppStore Connect, or whatever store front you use prior to submitting to Indie App Sales
- Shouldn't need to be said, but please don't alter other people's records (behave!)
- Find the category that matches your app (last column), and then try to add your entry in Alphabetical order, BY DEVELOPER. This should help to avoid most manual merges between different PR's, as changes will be in different parts of the doc.
- Before submitting and after merging, please verify that your links are all working. I'll do my best to keep them consistent, but errors may happen.

**Also:** In your merge description, please answer the following question: "Do you consent to having your app icon used in promotional materials?"

Thanks so much for participating!
